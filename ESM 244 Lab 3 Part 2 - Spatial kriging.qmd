# Overview

Here we will explore creating a variogram in R using groundwater depth data, and use that variogram to estimate groundwater depth in other areas. To do this, we will interpolate missing values using the kriging method.

# Read in the California depth-to-groundwater data

**Data source:** California Department of Water Resources. (2016). Groundwater Depth, California, Fall 2013. California Department of Water Resources. Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/py212tb3061.

These data are measurements for depth to groundwater recorded in 2013. We'll read in the layer with `read_sf()`, check the CRS, then make a quick plot to start.

```{r}
### Read in the CA county data (TIGER shapefile):
ca_counties_sf <- read_sf(here("data/ca_counties"), layer = "CA_Counties_TIGER2016") %>%  # saying "layer" tells it this is a .shp file
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(name) # this selects the names AND ALSO the geometry column

### Read in the depth to groundwater layer: 
ca_dgw_sf <- read_sf(here('data/ca_dgw', 
                          'F2013_DBGS_Points_20150720_093252.gpkg')) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

```

## Explore the data

Take time to check the CRSs for each layer, transform if necessary, and then make a quick visualization.

```{r}
### Check the projection of the two layers
st_crs(ca_counties_sf) ### Pseudomercator, epsg:3857
st_crs(ca_dgw_sf)      ### WGS 84, epsg:4326

### update the groundwater data to match the counties CRS,
### and rename important variable for clarity
ca_dgw_sf <- st_transform(ca_dgw_sf, st_crs(ca_counties_sf)) %>%
  rename(depth = dgbs)

### can also tell it the EPSG code directly if you know it
# ca_dgw_sf <- st_transform(ca_dgw_sf, 3857)

### Make a quick ggplot:
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = ca_counties_sf) +
  geom_sf(data = ca_dgw_sf, aes(color = depth))
```

## Map these interactively to explore further

(not done in lab)

```{r}
#| eval: false ### don't include interactive map in the HTML
#| echo: true

tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(ca_dgw_sf) +
  tm_dots(col = "depth", palette = 'Blues')
### note - no CA map here, Leaflet does that for us

### check out all the palettes:
# tmaptools::palette_explorer() ### need package shinyjs
```

# Focus on San Joaquin County

Let's just look at depth to groundwater (ft) in and around San Joaquin County.

```{r}
### Just get sj_county
sj_county_sf <- ca_counties_sf %>% 
  filter(name == "San Joaquin") # keep just county name and its geometry

### Now keep observations for groundwater depth within that county:
sj_depth_sf <- ca_dgw_sf %>% 
  # SPATIAL JOIN would also work
  # ST_INTERSECTION takes just the part that overlaps (intersects)
  # between the two
  st_intersection(sj_county_sf)

### Make a quick plot of those: 
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = sj_county_sf) +
  geom_sf(data = sj_depth_sf, aes(color = depth)) +
  theme_void()


# or interactive version:
tm_shape(sj_county_sf) +
  tm_fill() +
  tm_shape(sj_depth_sf) +
  tm_dots(col = "depth")
```

# Spatial interpolation

## Make a variogram

Here, the "formula" specifies the dependent variable and possible covariates. Our dependent variable is depth, and we won't include any covariates, so just `depth ~ 1`.

```{r}
sj_dgw_vgm <- gstat::variogram(depth ~ 1, data = sj_depth_sf)
### what if we wanted to consider other covariates? e.g., elevation?
# sj_dgw_vgm <- gstat::variogram(depth ~ gs_elevati, data = sj_depth_sf)
# This is like doing a multiple regression. Depth as a function of 
# distance but also considering elevation.

### Plot it
plot(sj_dgw_vgm) 
### Looks variogramish! Increasing variance as observations get further
### apart. Let's model this...

### Now create the variogram model, & see ?vgm for other model options: 
vgm_fit <- fit.variogram(sj_dgw_vgm,
                         ### (leave with defaults first)
                        #  model = vgm(model = "Gau")) # Gaussian model 
# fit to the variogram data
                         ### (then allow it to consider a nugget component)
                         model = vgm(model = "Gau", nugget = TRUE))
# allows the nugget to be something other than zero, and the fit improves

### Plot them together:
plot(sj_dgw_vgm, vgm_fit) 
# plots the fit line on top of the points.

### You can check the sum of squares of residuals for different models: 
attr(vgm_fit, 'SSErr') # ...and you could compare to other models...
# Sum of squared error 

```

## Spatial kriging

```{r}
### Make a grid over which we'll krige: 
sj_grid <- st_bbox(sj_county_sf) %>%
  # Draw a square over the exact right size for the county
  stars::st_as_stars(dx = 1000, dy = 1000) # how big the grid should be
# so it's a 1 km grid

### Look at the grid we made: 
plot(sj_grid)

# Data + variogram model + grid come together in function krige:
### Perform ordinary kriging: 
dgw_krige <- krige(depth ~ 1, # variogram model
                   sj_depth_sf, # known well depth locations
                   sj_grid, # predict locations on this grid
                   model = vgm_fit) # and fit the model

### Initial plot of kriging outcome: 
plot(dgw_krige)

```

## Making a final plot

```{r}
### Convert krige object to a raster using the terra package
krige_rast <- dgw_krige %>% 
  ### tell it the x, y, and CRS
  terra::rast() %>%
  setNames(c('pred', 'var'))

### Then we can use ggplot: 
ggplot() +
  tidyterra::geom_spatraster(data = krige_rast, aes(fill = pred)) +
  # tidyterra::geom_spatraster(data = krige_rast, aes(fill = var)) +
  geom_sf(data = sj_depth_sf, aes(fill = depth), shape = 21) +
  # Fills the points with the actual well depth
  geom_sf(data = sj_county_sf, color = 'black', fill = NA) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "yellow")

# See how our variance goes up quite a lot outside of the area close to the points we're interpolating from. 
ggplot() +
  tidyterra::geom_spatraster(data = krige_rast, aes(fill = var)) +
  # tidyterra::geom_spatraster(data = krige_rast, aes(fill = var)) +
  geom_sf(data = sj_depth_sf, aes(fill = depth), shape = 21) +
  # Fills the points with the actual well depth
  geom_sf(data = sj_county_sf, color = 'black', fill = NA) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "yellow")
```

We could try other models and compare how well these other models predict well depth, using cross validation - set aside a few wells out of our dataset, train the variogram on the remaining wells, run the interpolation, then see how well the kriging model predicts those set-aside wells.
